      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
This specification describes the Merkle Proof Signature Suite created in 2017 for the
Linked Data Signatures [[LD-SIGNATURES]] specification. It uses the RDF
Dataset CANONICALIZATION Algorithm [[RDF-DATASET-CANONICALIZATION]] to transform the
input document into its canonical form. It uses SHA-256 [[RFC6234]] as the
<a>message digest algorithm</a> and the RS256 algorithm defined in
JSON Web Signatures [[RFC7515]] as the <a>signature algorithm</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Terminology</h2>
      <p>
The following terms are used to describe concepts involved in the
generation and verification of the Linked Data Signature 2017
<a>signature suite</a>.
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt><dfn>signature suite</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
A specified set of cryptographic primitives typically consisting of
a canonicalization algorithm, a message digest algorithm, and a signature
algorithm that are bundled together by cryptographers for developers
for the purposes of safety and convenience.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>canonicalization algorithm</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
An algorithm that takes an input document that has more than one possible
representation and always transforms it into a canonical form. This process is
sometimes also called CANONICALIZATION.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>message digest algorithm</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
An algorithm that takes an input message and produces a cryptographic
output message that is often many orders of magnitude smaller than the
input message. These algorithms are often 1) very fast, 2)
non-reversible, 3) cause the output to change significantly when even one
bit of the input message changes, and 4) make it infeasible to find two
different inputs for the same output.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>signature algorithm</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
An algorithm that takes an input message and produces an output value where the
receiver of the message can mathematically verify that the message has not
been modified in transit and came from someone possessing a particular secret.
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <h2>The 2017 Merkle Proof Signature Suite</h2>

      <p>
The 2017 Merkle Proof <a>signature suite</a> MUST be used in
conjunction with the signing and verification algorithms in the
Linked Data Signatures [[LD-SIGNATURES]] specification. The suite consists of
the following algorithms:

      <table class="simple">
        <thead>
          <th>Parameter</th>

      <h2>Modification to Algorithms</h2>

      <p>
This signature suite uses the [[LDS-KOBLITZ2016]]. The signature algorithm uses
the Koblitz Elliptic Curve, also known as secp256k1, used by Bitcoin and Ethereum.
      <p>

      <section>
        <h3>Modifications to Signature Algorithm</h3>

        <p>
The <var>digital signature algorithm</var> defined in Section 7.1:
Signature Algorithm takes an array of <var>tbs</var>, a <var>privateKey</var>,
and </var><var>options</var> as inputs and produces a
<var>signatureValue</var> as output.
        </p>
        <ol class="algorithm">
          <li>
Take an array of <var>tbs</var>, which is an array of the data to be signed, as input and generate
a Merkle Tree.
          </li>
          <li>
Include the root of the Merkle Tree ("Merkle Root") in the data field of the Blockchain transaction. For Bitcoin this is the OP_RETURN field.
          </li>
          <li>
Sign the transaction with encoding of <var>privateKey</var> appropriate for the blockchain. For Bitcoin this is
a WIF encoding. Per the signature suite definition, this is using [[LDS-KOBLITZ2016]].
          </li>
          <li>
For each <var>tbs</var>, create the signature element, which includes:
            <ul>
              <li>
The hash of the element as <em>targetHash</em>
              </li>
              <li>
The merkle root as <em>merkleRoot</em>
              </li>
              <li>
The Merkle Proof for <var>tbs</var>, which is the path from <em>targetHash</em> to <em>merkleRoot</em> in the
Merkle Tree, as <em>proof</em>. The should not include the endpoints of the path (<em>targetHash</em> and
<em>merkleRoot</em>)
              </li>
              <li>
The blockchain anchor(s) as <em>anchors</em>. This describes how to look up the blockchain transaction. Its fields
include the type of blockchain transaction as <em>type</em> and the transaction id as <em>sourceId</em>.
              </li>
            </ul>
          <li>
Return the result as <em>signatureValue</em>.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>

        <div class="issue">List all blockchain <em>type</em> values. Note that we should call out testnet explicitly</div>

    <section>
        <h3>Modifications to Signature Verification Algorithm</h3>

        <p>
The <var>digital signature algorithm</var> defined in Section 7.2:
Signature Verification Algorithm takes the value to be verified,
a <em>tbv</em>, the <em>public key</em> to the signature algorithm
and returns a boolean value.
        </p>
        <ol class="algorithm">
          <li>
Validate the values <em>targetHash</em>, <em>proof</em>, and <em>merkleRoot</em> form a valid Merkle Path.
          </li>
          <li>
Verify that <em>targetHash</em> matches the JSON-LD canonicalized, SHA256 Hash of <var>tbv</var>.
          </li>
          <li>
Verify <em>merkleRoot</em> matches what is stored in the transaction at <em>sourceId</em> on blockchain <em>type</em>.
          </li>
          <li>
If all of the above checks pass, return <code>true</code>, otherwise return <code>false</code>.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <div class="issue">Add references and more pointers to merkle tree operations.</div>
        <div class="issue">Should we use tx ref encoding instead of txids?</div>
    </section>

    </section>

      <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
      <p>
The following section describes security considerations that developers
implementing this specification should be aware of in order to create secure
software.
      </p>

<div class="issue">TODO: We need to add a complete list of security
considerations.</div>
